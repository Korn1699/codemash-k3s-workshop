# Half the Size, Twice as Awesome: Kubernetes for All of Us (Workshop)

Getting started with Kubernetes is a daunting task. Everyone you talked to said it was a pain to get started, but it eventually paid off (unless youâ€™re Docker). What if I told you there was a solution to the startup pain? What if it was something to get your feet wet with, cut your teeth on -- but just as conformant and production ready?

In this workshop, we will not only get our feet wet with Kubernetes, we will get a production-ready instance of Kubernetes up and running. 

**Thank you to [RamNode](https://www.ramnode.com/) for providing computing credits to ensure all attendees are successful!**

## Level

This workshop is intended for beginner (introductory and overview) skill levels. This workshop will be slow paced to ensure that attendees are successful in:

- Creating their own production-ready Kubernetes instance
- Understanding basic of Kubernetes
- Kubernetes tooling, command line and debugging

**The primary goal of this workshop is to demonstrate that Kubernetes is approachable and is for all of us.**

 We will focus on using GUI tools to operate our single instance of Kubernetes. While we will dip into the command line, a majority of the workshop will focus on the GUI tooling.

### Lens (Kubernetes IDE)

We will be exploring k3s/Kubernetes via a IDE called [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) (Supported on Windows, Intel Mac, M1 Mac, Linux). 

### HTTP Client

We will be issuing HTTP requests throughout the workshop. One of two HTTP clients should be installed. **Please note that Fiddler is not recommend. We will be modifying host headers. This is difficult and error prone with Fiddler**
